\section{Introduction}

Earth is permanently bombarded with cosmic rays. Primary cosmic rays consist of protons (90\,\%), $\alpha$-particles (12,5\,\%) and heavier nuclei (2,5\,\%) \cite{wwu}. Through interaction of primary rays with the Earth's atmosphere, secondary rays are produced. Further nuclear processes, which will be discussed in detail later on, lead to the production of muons (amongst others). These muons are supposed to be detected within the following experiments.

In particular, the mean lifetime of muons stopped in the used detector module is measured, as well as the dependency of cosmic rays' spectrum and count rate on zenith angle. This way, not only the existence of cosmic rays and correctness of nuclear processes to produce muons is proven, but also the characteristics of cosmic rays detected at sea level can be quantified.
